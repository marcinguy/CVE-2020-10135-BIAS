# CVE-2020-10135-BIAS
CVE 2020-10135 a.k.a BIAS (Bluetooth Impersonation Attack)

Seems like after a while and jumping through some hoops was able to perform BIAS (Bluetooth Impersonation Attack) CVE 2020-10135. Impersonated Samsung S3 Neo+ connection to Linux host. Cool stuff. THANK YOU for Internalblue and BIAS PoCs.

From my perspective found out that pretty much all you need to perform the attack is the BT address of inpersonated device that was previously paired and connected with the other end. Rest you can obtain for PoC to work.
